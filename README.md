## 🙏 Personal Dedication

This project is not only a technical work, but also a deeply personal spiritual offering.

There was a time of repeated failures in my life, when I had lost faith and became an atheist. In complete surrender and with no other hope left, I turned to **Gurunath Sree Bala Subrahmanya Swamy** as my final refuge.

From a failed and broken individual, I became a **shishyan** — a devoted student — guided, protected, and lifted by my Gurunath.

This project stands as my **dakshina**, my gratitude, and my life’s tribute to my Gurunath.  
The name **“Sreebala”** itself is inseparable from this journey, as both my life and this organization were built by His grace.
